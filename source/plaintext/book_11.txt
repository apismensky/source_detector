The chapter focuses on one particular algorithmic system developed for public transport security and explores the ways in which the system provided a basis for experimenting with what computer scientists termed human-shaped objects. In contrast to much of the social science literature on algorithms that suggests the algorithm itself is more or less fxed or inscrutable, this chapter will instead set out one basis for ethnographically studying the algorithm up-close and in detail. Placing algorithms under scrutiny opens up the opportunity for studying their instability and the ceaseless experimentation to which they are subjected. An important basis for this experimentation, the chapter will suggest, is elegance. The chapter will suggest that elegance opens up a distinct way to conceive of the experimental prospects of algorithms under development and their ways of composing humans.

In this chapter, I will focus on the question of how an algorithm can (at least begin to) participate in everyday life. I will set out one particular project that provided a means to get close to the everyday life of an algorithm (or what might be more appropriately termed an ‘algorithmic system’, as we will go on to see). I will then investigate one focus for algorithmic experimentation in this project: efforts to identify humans. As the project developed, the notion of human-shaped objects became more and more apparent in project documents,
