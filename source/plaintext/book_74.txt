agent checks if the firing behaviour of MN is acceptable according to R 251 12.8 An illustrative diagram that shows the creation of a new synapse by a second level neighbour for helping an inactive neuron. Initially three neuron agents are considered: Neuron-1 (N1), Neuron-2 (N2) and Neuron-3 (N3). Although the synapse between Neuron-1 and Neuron-2 is strong enough to activate (fire) Neuron-2, the synapse between Neuron-2 and Neuron-3 is not strong enough to activate Neuron-3. In this sense, the expected behaviour of this sub-society is to create a synapse between Neuron-1 and Neuron-3 256 12.9 An illustrative diagram for the ‘self-organization of reflex pathways’ macro-level testing scenario. Initially there are four agents: an Afferent-Neuron agent (AN), a Motoneuron agent (MN), a Muscle agent (MU) and a WiringViewer agent (WV). The Motoneuron agent uses the reference experimental data (R) to calibrate its tonic firing behaviour. The WiringViewer uses the same data to compare the simulated behaviour of the system to the real system 259 12.10 PSF-CUSUM diagrams for both reference and simulated data. The PSF-CUSUM of reference data (on the top) is calculated by using the soleus muscle single motor unit PSF values given in Figure 12.6. The PSF-CUSUM of simulated data (in the bottom) is calculated by using the motoneuron agent’s latest discharge 262 14.1 Emergence 293 14.2 Evolution of a Schelling grid and the emergence of segregation 293 14.3 Activity diagram showing a disease process as a DES queuing network 298 Tables 3.1 Cellular automata classifications 36 4.1 Equations for calculating rate of colonization of the susceptible patients 54 List of Figures and Tables xi xii List of Figures and Tables 5.1 Purchasing scenarios 67 6.1 The evacuation sequence of the 25 strategies 85 7.1 Sample frequency distribution values 110 7.2 Sample probabilities 111 7.3 Definitions for each type of customer 113 7.4 Descriptive statistics for experiment 1 (all to 2 d.p.) 118 7.5 Definition of customer type configurations 120 7.6 Descriptive statistics for ANOVA variables (all to 2 d.p.) 123 8.1 Different stages of drug development (time and the probability of success) 140 8.2 Rules for individual players and for their interaction 143 8.3 Number of simulations conforming to industry data at 5% significance level 148 9.1 Failure classes 169 9.2 Average number of finished products for five work scheduling strategies and two failure handling strategies 178 9.3 Average number of finished products for five work scheduling strategies and two failure handling strategies (with five different failure classes) using 30 pallets 179 9.4 Correlation analysis for number of pallets, class of conveyor failure (CF) and class of machine failure (MF) to system effectiveness 180 10.1 Local banker attributes 189 10.2 Firm attributes 193 10.3 Bank Model attributes 195 10.4 The Bank Model event schedule 196 10.5 Attributes of the credit class 196 10.6 Transfer of results for the question regarding available post-credit decision actions to Model action 197 10.7 Mean and standard deviation of expected credit losses at various PPD limits 202 11.1 Maximum range of a fired musket ball 216 11.2 Pseudocode of stress evaluation 217 11.3 Pseudocode of musket impacts 218 11.4 Percentage of victory for different tactics, shown as Red side success 225 List of Figures and Tables xiii 11.5 Outcome of simulated engagements between Fire by Rank and Platoon systems 226 13.1 Outline for a daylong introductory course on agent-based modeling 282 13.2 Outline for a weeklong introductory course on agent-based modeling 283 13.3 Outline for a quarter or semester introductory course on agent-based modeling 284 13.4 Outline for a quarter or semester advanced course on agent-based modeling 285 1 Introducing agent-based modeling and simulation Simon JE Taylor Brunel University, UK 1 Modeling & simulation The manager of an Accident and Emergency (A&E) service (or Emergency Room) has a problem. The waiting room of her Unit is always full of patients waiting to see her clinical staff. Patients arrive, are checked in by a receptionist and then wait until they are seen by a nurse. If an arriving patient is in obvious distress then the patient is seen as soon as a nurse is available. The nurse records their medical details, discusses them with a doctor and then proceeds with a range of possible actions to treat the patient or to pass the patient on to another department. How can the manager understand how to reduce the number of patients waiting to see the nurse? Should she hire more nurses? Are doctors in short supply? Are nurses waiting for information from other departments? What about alternative arrival arrangements—should the reception team have clinical skills to make an earlier assessment of patients’ needs? Modeling & simulation (M&S) makes it possible for the A&E manager to create a verifiable and valid computer model of her system and to simulate it under different
