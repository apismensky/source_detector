intermingled in a disastrous display of technical ineffcacy. What had seemed like reasonable demonstrations of the algorithms’ capabilities to ethical audiences, now had to be questioned. Questions of the material integrity of these demonstrations (and the extent to which a relation of undoubted correspondence could be maintained between the system put on show and the world to which it pointed) were only matched by questions of their visual integrity (of who and what was in a position to see who and what). These questions continued and even grew for a time as our algorithms moved towards their fnal demonstrations to research funders. The king of Event Detection—abandoned luggage—could only be demonstrated through a careful whittling away of confounding variables. The fooring, lighting, luggage-type, positioning, behaviour of the luggage’s human owner, frame rate of the camera and other human-shaped objects of the airport each had to be closely controlled. In place of the algorithm going out into the world grasping or composing real time, real space everyday life, a more modest and controlled everyday had to be brought to the system. And so we fnd in our fnal chapter that the algorithms are somewhat quiet. Away from the drama of contemporary academic writing and popular media stories, the algorithms take up a meek position in an Exploitation Report. In place of any fanfare regarding their technical effcacy, comes a carefully composed account, depending on imaginative and dextrous calculative work. Here, more and less valued geographical regions, customer types and inferior competitors stand in as proxies for our algorithms. The calculations, instead of talking about current technical effcacies, point towards a future potential of market value that could be achieved with investment. The performative accomplishment of the investment proposition negates the need for our algorithms’ everyday life to be put on display. At the end, they are not entirely absent from our story, but from the Exploitation Report their grasp and composition of everyday life, their prospects of becoming the everyday of the airport and train station, are deleted.
