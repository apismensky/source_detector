widely used technique of DES, Brailsford continues the ongoing debate of whether or not ABMS is unique, and requires dedicated methods and technology, or the themes of ABMS can be captured and implemented using more established DES techniques. Several case studies are used to illustrate this argument. 4 Summary The study of complex adaptive systems with ABMS is one of the most fascinating aspects of M&S today. The following articles presented in this OR Essentials will introduce the reader to a wide range of ABMS theoretical viewpoints, technologies and application areas. To get started with ABMS the reader may consider using one of the following freely or commercially available ABMS software. Each has excellent supporting materials and is appropriate for a range of technical abilities.
