We also fnd Sokal’s fake social science paper sitting alongside a greater number of fake natural science discoveries (e.g. in cloning: http:// news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacifc/4554422.stm and http:// www.newscientist.com/article/dn8515-cloning-pioneer-did-fake-results-probe-fnds.html#.UoON3YlFBjp) and fakes in other felds such as psychology (see faked data in claims that white people fear black people more in areas that are dirty or that people act in a more selfsh manner when hungry: http://news.sciencemag.org/education/2011/09/ dutch-university-sacks-social-psychologist-over-faked-data). 11.

(2011) cite the example of the portrait of the Doge Pietro Loredano which was and then wasn’t and now is again considered a painting by Tintoretto. 14. I use the term integrity here rather than provenance or an evidential focus on “chain of custody” (Lynch 1998: 848) as a frst step towards exploring index-context relations (taken up further in the next section). 15. Indexical is used in the ethnomethodological sense here, see Garfnkel (1967). 16. For more on the complexities of seeing, see, for example: Daston and Galison (1992), Fyfe and Law (1988), Goodwin (1994, 1995), Goodwin and Goodwin (1996), Hindmarsh (2009), Jasanoff (1998), and Suchman (1993). 17. In a similar manner to Latour’s allies of scientifc experiments sent out into the world to attest to the strength of a scientifc fact or discovery. 18. Real time and real space here refer to the naturally occurring unfolding of events in the train station and airport in contrast to the experimental stage of the project where spaces and the timing of events might be more controlled. Here, our algorithms would have to make their frst steps into a less controlled environment, causing anxiety for the computer scientists. 120 D. NEYLAND References Alder, C., Chappell, D., & Polk, K.
