technology). However, accountability work was also uncertain and a little precarious with the world of relations of people and things assembled to do accountability, shifting between certainty and uncertainty. The study of making deleting accountable, emphasised this precariousness— to prove that nothing existed as a result of something being deleted, without resurrecting the thing deleted, proved an ongoing conceptual and practical challenge. As we will see in Chapter 5, this was only the start of a series of challenges for our algorithms. References Article 29 Working Party Accountability Principle. (2010).

As the project reached its fnal deadlines and put on demonstrations of the technology-underdevelopment to various audiences—including the project funders—it became ever more apparent that in a number of ways promises made to key audiences, may not be met. In project meetings, it became rapidly apparent that a number of ways of constituting a response to different audiences and their imagined demands could be offered. To manage this problem, the chapter shows that a range of different more or less ‘genuine’ demonstrations with greater or lesser integrity were discursively assembled by the project team, and ways to locate and populate, witness and manage the assessment of these demonstrations were brought to the table. The notion of integrity is used to incorporate sight, materiality
